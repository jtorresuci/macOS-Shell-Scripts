### Running a Bash Script

1. **Make the Script Executable**: If the script isn't already executable, give it execute permission using the `chmod` command. Replace `script.sh` with the name of your script.

   chmod +x script.sh

Run the Script: Execute the Bash script by typing its name preceded by ./ and pressing Enter. Replace script.sh with the actual name of your Bash script.

./script.sh

Follow Script Instructions: Depending on the script's purpose, it may display information or prompt for input. Follow any on-screen instructions provided by the script.
